We have carefully read the WAHS Robotics Team Charter (available at [https://westashleyrobotics.com](https://westashleyrobotics.com)). As a student, I am aware of the responsibilities I must fulfill in order to be a successful member of this team; especially those rules associated with my attendance and participation on the robotics team. As a parent, I am aware of the responsibilities expected for my child and will maintain an open line of communication with the coach.
