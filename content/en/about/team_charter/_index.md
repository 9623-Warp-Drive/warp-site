This charter is designed to outline the organizational layout of the robotics team so that students will have a structured environment in which to explore their interests in robotics and related topics.

**Mission Statement:** The West Ashley High School robotics program is dedicated to fostering a passion in STEM related engineering throughout the Lowcountry community. Our program will inspire young students to become self-confident technology leaders by engaging them in exciting team-based robotic challenges that build STEM skills and inspire innovation.

**Our Objective**: To form a viable, competitive robotics program to compete in VEX Robotics Competitions (VRC) across various design platforms on a yearly basis. The team will organize and field as many competitive robots as possible per year and all robots will compete under the “West Ashley High School,” “Team 9623,” and “WARP Drive” headings.

Our program will also provide a creative outlet for West Ashley High School students to:

- Apply STEM concepts

- Learn designing, prototyping, and concept testing

- Learn teamwork and leadership skills

- Provide interactions between students and real active engineers in industry

## Team Objectives

Our goals for the upcoming season include all that we accomplished our previous seasons, plus:

- Advance to the state, national, and world championships... and win!
- Be competitive in both the driver skills challenge and the programming skills challenge. Specific goals include finishing in the top 10 for Driver Skills and top 5 for Programming Skills.
- Win an Excellence Award at the state championship.
- Continue to mentor other robotics teams, such as those from Wando HS, PSA HS, West Ashley Advanced Studies Magnet MS, and Laing Middle School.
- Continue to partner with the robotics program at Goose Creek HS.
- Increase our scouting ability during competitions.
- Develop new relationships with sponsors and local community businesses.
- Increase VRC awareness in the Lowcountry area by hosting a second event at West Ashley High School.
- Continue to develop VRC interest in the elementary and middle schools by hosting robotics demonstrations at events such as “Back to School Night” and “WAHS Open House.”
- Submit entries for every online challenge.
- Educate new team members on the way that our program operates, introduce them to the VEX materials, and work with them on their interpersonal “soft” skills in preparation for judge interviews.
- Improved communication between team members, coaches, mentors, and administrators.
- Increase our publicity to help make our team more accessible to students interested in robotics.
- Help students from other schools become inspired to form robotics teams at their school under the WARP Drive heading.

## Responsibilities of Team Members

### I. Chain of Command & Expectations of Leaders

Team captains will be selected and assigned by the coaches at the beginning of each season.

1. Teams comprised entirely of new members will be assigned a captain once someone on the team has proven they can handle the position. Until a captain is assigned, the coaches and/or other team captains will handle the leadership responsibilities.
2. As a team member, questions/concerns relative to your individual team should be directed to the captain, whereas questions/concerns about the program may be directed towards the coaches.
3. All team members will comply with the team captain’s daily directives in the building/programming of the squad’s robot, recording information in the engineering notebook, and general maintenance/organization/upkeep of both the robot and the robotics lab workspace.
4. All team members, including captains, are expected to:
   1. Maintain a clean, organized, and safe robotics workspace throughout the season.
   2. Attend all team events announced by coaches with a least two weeks’ notice.
      1. If a member fails to attend a competition, without prior notice to coaches, he/she will be immediately suspended until he/she meets with coaches to explain absences.
      2. Failure to provide an adequate explanation for an unplanned absence may result in a suspension from team activities.
      3. Subsequent violations will result in removal from team.
5. Team captains must maintain an open line of communication between themselves and the coach, other captains, and each member of their individual teams.
   - Captains will collect contact information for all team members and use this channel of communication to communicate information received from the coaches.

### II. Communication & Social Media

WARP Drive utilizes public and private social media outlets for the secure transfer of team information and to assist with sharing team photos, videos, announcements, schedules, and event details.

1. Team members and parents are encouraged to utilize all WARP Drive social media outlets; however, all team members MUST join and monitor the Discord chat. This page serves as the primary source for communicating pertinent and time-sensitive team information.
2. Team members and parents should not post inappropriate comments, criticisms, individual grievances, irrelevant/personal conversations, questions/comments which do not serve the betterment of the entire group, or any photos, videos, or text that does not strictly align with the WARP Drive Mission Statement or Team Objectives.
3. Prior to the state robotics championships, team members and parents should never publicly post photos or videos that depict our specific robots, designs, or capabilities.
4. Posting photos/videos of team members, parents, or coaches, without permission, is also prohibited.

### III. Participation and Attendance

A team member must be a contributing member of the team and his/her squad.

1. Team members may not participate in any team events until a team charter has been signed by the student and a parent and has been submitted to the coach.
2. Team members may not miss more than 3 unexplained meetings throughout the entire season or once the student joins the team.
3. Team members must arrive at the robotics lab for meetings on time (3:00 pm) and stay throughout the entire practice session.
4. Team members may not participate in any other sports, clubs, or activities, which meet on a conflicting schedule without special permission. Students who wish to be a part of these other activities must receive this special permission from the coach and captain when absences due to conflict occur.
5. The robotics team is not a social club. Students who do not actively further the objectives of their team will be asked to leave.
6. Team members are required to wear their team shirts to competitions and events in which they are representing the team.
7. Failing to actively participate may result in:
   1. Member being pulled aside and warned/counseled.
   2. Member being suspended from the team for 2 weeks.
   3. Member being expelled from the team for the remainder of the season.
8. Team members will attend all team events announced by coaches with a least two weeks’ notice.

### V. Academic Integrity

All WARP Drive team members must be in good academic standing at WAHS in order to participate in this robotics program. Team members with unsatisfactory grades (< 80%) or poor grades (< 65%), in any course, will be placed on academic probation and may be suspended from team activities until all grades improve. At the end of each quarter, students may be asked to submit a copy of their report card.

Our rules about grades are in place due to previous problems with team members not being allowed to go on certain trips. We would like to prevent this problem from occurring and we also have high standards for our group of future engineers. We acknowledge that academics come before robotics and have high academic expectations for our team members.

1. “Good Academic Standing” occurs when a team member earns grades of 80% or higher in every course.
   - Teachers will be consulted to determine suitability and have final determination on grades.

2. “Unsatisfactory Academic Standing” occurs when a team member earns a grade of less than 80% on a progress report or report card, in at least one course, including Mechatronics, if applicable. Any team member in “Unsatisfactory Academic Standing”:
   1. Will be given notice that he/she must raise his/her grades.
   2. Will be placed on academic probation for two weeks, (beginning at the time of the first notice), to improve all course grades to above 80%.
      - During the two-week academic probation, the team member may participate in team practices.
   3. Failing to improve all grades to above 80% within the two-week academic probation will result in the team member being placed on academic suspension. They must forego all team activities until the course instructor acknowledges, in writing, that the course grade has improved to above 80%.

3. “Poor Academic Standing” occurs when a team member earns a grade of less than 65% on a progress report or report card, in at least one course, including Mechatronics, if applicable. Any team member in “Poor Academic Standing”:
   1. Will be given notice that he/she must raise his/her grades.
   2. Will be placed directly on academic suspension until all course grades have improved to above 80%.
      - During academic suspension, the team member may not participate in ANY team activities, practices, events, competitions, and/or trips.
   3. Will remain on academic suspension and must forego all team activities until the course instructor acknowledges, in writing, that the course grade has improved to above 80%.
      - In the event that a student remains on academic suspension for four weeks, the team member will be removed from the team for the remainder of the season.
