WARP Drive is committed to enriching the community through our many outreach programs. Among others, we create and mentor VRC teams at local elementary and middle schools, perform robotics demonstrations at major events around the community, and host VRC competitions at our school.

## Creating new VRC teams
In 2014, WARP Drive made the offer to create and mentor new VRC teams at any local elementary or middle school interested in implementing a robotics program.  Two middle schools have signed up for our offer, and we have been working together ever since.

Currently, WARP Drive has created, and continues to mentor, three new VRC middle school teams. We meet with each team 3 or 4 times per month, travel to competitions together, and serve as mentors and role models for these future WARP Drive team members!

## Hosting community events
WARP Drive performs dozens of demonstrations at various locations and events around the Charleston area.  We demo our robots at many career fairs, STEM festivals, technology conferences, back-to-school nights, PTA meetings, and we were even invited to exhibit our program at the national DIG Show Technology and Innovation Conference!

In addition to these demonstrations, we also host VRC competitions at our school, including the VRC State Championship for South Carolina in the 2018-2019 season and the 2019-2020 season. This allows local students to participate in robotics competitions that may otherwise require lengthy travel.

## Providing free Robotics summer camps for all CCSD students
WARP Drive team members give up three weeks of their summer vacation to provide an engaging and fun robotics camp designed to introduce VEX Robotics and other STEM-related topics to any and all CCSD students who may be interested. These camps are free to everyone and have continued to grow in popularity each summer.

During the first week of camp, students construct a basic "Claw-Bot" using VEX robotics equipment from our program.  Various fun and engaging challenges are worked on throughout the week, which culminates in a Swept Away competition.  The second and third weeks of camp focus on programming.  Field trips to Boeing, Cummins, and SPAWAR are also provided for students so that they may make a connection with the relevance of the STEM content we teach at camp.
